# HTML/CSS website clone project (McDonald's)

Welcome to my McDonald's website clone project, using HTML and CSS.

## Description

This clone is based on the URL:(https://www.mcdonalds.com/us/en-us/about-our-food/meet-our-food-experts.html), and aims at mimicing structuring, layout and styling as much as possible. 

## Structuring

I have structured the website using the appropriate layout, such as grid or flexbox, mainly by oberving the page and tried to limit my usage of Chrome DevTools to the bare minimums such as font-sizes, exact background color codes etc.

## Special CSS features

Certain features that I have focused on, apart from the general HTML and CSS, are the button :active function and tooltips for the first three links in the main body content. Media queries have been added for a responsive design to adjust to different screen sizes. 

## Additional notes

The CSS styling is contained in a single '.css' file, but is separated with comments as headings of each new section for easier overview.
